## About <a name = "about"></a>

This extension can help you save links quickly. For instance, if you are scrolling through TikTok and you find a funny video, you want to share with a friend. Common issue there is when almost every of your tiktoks is funny and you want to share each one of them, but copying and pasting links takes a lot of time and can be boring. However this extension will help you! It is used for saving link to a list that can be viewed in a popup when you click on the extension icon! So now saving links takes approximately 50 ms and you and your friends are happy and laughing because of these TikToks you send them.
